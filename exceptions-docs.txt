### Configuring Exceptions

You can exempt specific users and channels from message deletion:

1. **User Exceptions**: Add user IDs as positive integers
2. **Channel Exceptions**: Add channel IDs as negative integers (usually starting with -100)

Example format for the `EXCEPTIONS` setting:

```text
12345,-1001234567890,98765
```

This would exempt:

- User with ID 12345
- Channel with ID -1001234567890
- User with ID 98765

To get channel IDs, you can:

1. Forward a message from the channel to @userinfobot
2. Use @username_to_id_bot to convert channel usernames to IDs
